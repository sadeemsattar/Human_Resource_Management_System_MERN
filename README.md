The SMTP protocol is implemented with NodeMailer whenever any Employee is registered with our system, an email is send to that employee for successfull registration.

The QRScanner is implemented to scan QR for the attendance. Furthermore, the client IP is then authenticated with the organizationâ€™s IP to check whether the client is connected with the organization network and is within the premises to mark the attendance.  

# Architecture

The HRMS is composed on the Client Server Architecture. 

The users of the system provide the request to the web based HRMS system to fetch their respective data and page portal. It will generate the HTTP client request that will be accepted by the server with the TCP Protocol to assess the HTTP request [2]. The server then provides with the accurate result as per the client request and respond with the HTTP response.
